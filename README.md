# This module will create A Public Exposed Fargate Service with Private Networking

This architecture deploys your container into a private subnet. 
The containers do not have direct internet access, or a public IP address.
Their outbound traffic must go out via a NAT gateway, and receipients of 
requests from the containers will just see the request orginating from 
the IP address of the NAT gateway. However, inbound traffic from the public
can still reach the containers because there is a public facing load balancer
that can proxy traffic from the public to the containers in the private subnet.
